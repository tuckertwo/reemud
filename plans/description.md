# _Ademia_
Kavi Wilson and Tucker R. Twomey are collaborating to produce _Ademia_,
a multi-player text adventure game that combines the exploration- and puzzle-
based aspects of games like Colossal Cave Adventure and Zork with the
multi-player interaction, skills development, procedural generation,
and combat aspects of Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) systems and their descendants.

# Story and Introduction
> You find yourself in the middle of a reasonably-sized public square in the
> middle of a big city.
> Your watch reads 5:12 PM; it appears to be twilight,
> and a small breeze is blowing.
> 
> Everything appears normal, but after a while you notice that there is nobody
> around.
> After a while, the streetlights shut off and you are in darkness.
> Walking around, you find every possible sign of human activity but for the
> humans.
> It seems that, up until recently, you were just one of a crowd of
> city-dwellers going about their lives.
> But, now, there is nobody left but you.
> At least, that's what it seems.
>
> From here, you take your bearings and see to your north a public library,
> and to the east a small shelter over a staircase.
> To the west is Piedmont Avenue, and to the south is Harrisburg Street.
>
> Enter your action below; type `help` for advice.

The premise is as above,
though the players eventually discover monsters of varying amounts of sentience
and are able to interact with other players on the same server,
who find themselves in the same predicament as every other user (though they are
less alone).

Facilities include a library, providing for exposition and training;
an estuary, sewer system, subway system, or a network of catacombs or utility
tunnels with shadowy beings that could hold great amounts of loot;
plenty of utilities and services that have ceased to function,
the restoration (and control) of which would provide great benefits to players,
and plenty of other players who are able to help you, hinder you, and cause all
manner of political subplots.
